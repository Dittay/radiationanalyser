# radiationanalyser
A short portfolio project as part of the HyperionDev data science bootcamp to practice loops

This project consolidates learnings from undertaking the HyperionDev/CoGrammar bootcamp in data science.

● Fundamentals of for loops in Python.  
● Designing nested for loops for multi-layered data processing.  
● Using trace tables to monitor variable values during iterations.  
● Advantages of loop structures in reducing code redundancy and errors.  
● Differentiating between for and while loops and their applications.  
● Implementing 'break' and 'continue' within loops for enhanced control.  
● Practical applications of loops: processing extensive data sets and
calculating statistical metrics.  
● Debugging techniques within loop structures using IDE tools.
